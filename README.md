## Description

This app uses Node.js and the command line / terminal to create a professional ReadME. The app asks a bunch of questions to fill out the different sections of the readme. You first start out by typing Node.js in the terminal like below:

![Begin](/img/startScreen.PNG)

Then you fill out the question prompts and also choose which license you would like. There are default answers for a few of the prompts. 

![Halfway](/img/halfwayScreen.PNG)

Then when you are done with all the questions the terminal spits out your answers

![Finished](/img/finishedScreen.PNG)

And then finally the app creates a readME with a shield license logo at the top and a fully working Table of Contents with links and the pre-generated license text along with links to your gitHub user profile and whatever other information you gave. The ReadME is placed within the GeneratedReadMEs folder

## Installation

To use properly you need to install Node.js and in the terminal you have to use the command 
``` npm init ```
and then also
``` npm install inquirer ```  to initialize and then install the correct dependencies, in this
case, inquirer.
